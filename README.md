# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview  

* Intro  
* Figma  
* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  
  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

**Description**
This project demonstrated the use of grid, flexbox, and resposive design for different screen sizes.
Buttons and hover elements were also used.

**Improvements**
It would be nice to have descriptions for the different parks and landmarks of the U.S. Perhaps we could
add a hover element over each card that gives off a summary of each park, with a smooth transition when doing so.
